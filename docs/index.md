    <em>Code Analysis Package Manager</em>
</p>

Code analysis should be easy and fun, and one of the first things to set up for
a software project, not an afterthought.

CAPM is a package manager for all tools related code analysis. No matter if you
just want to run a linter, a code formatter, a duplication finder, or a
complete code quality suite, CAPM makes it simple (and fun!). 

### Key features and design principles

* **Get started today**: Only configure what is important
* **Powerful syntax**: Set defaults at high level, override at lower level
